# A javascript package to convert xpath expressions into a JSON array

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dorey/xpath-parser.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dorey/xpath-parser)

## This project is not being maintained. I will be rewriting it so that it uses a lexer such as [xpath-lexer](https://github.com/badeball/xpath-lexer)

Don't look at the code. It's not pretty.
